1. Start RapidSnapshot normally using the desktop icon.
2. Create your connection via the User Interface and note down the connection name.
3. Optional: create a template from the User Interface and note down the template name.
4. Modify the argument.xml file and populate the <connectionName> with the information from 2. (let <templateSelectionName> blank if you skipped 3.)
 change <logFolderPath> to be a real path on your system.
5. Rename "snapshot64.batx" to "snapshot64.bat"
6. You can call "snapshot64.bat" from any scheduling software to run RapidSnapshot automatically. Make sure the argument.xml file is located in the same
folder as the snapshot64.bat file.

Important: RapidSnapshot requires a display in order to run.
